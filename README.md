# SharpBlackout
 Terminate AV/EDR leveraging BYOVD attack 


> Note: This project is for educational purposes only.

Sharpblackout is an adaptation of the @Blackout project originally developed in C++ by @ZeroMemoryEx, which consists of removing AV/EDRs using the gmer (BYOVD) driver.

Just wanted to try making it in C#

❗️ **Important:** This requires Administrator privileges for it to work.

⚠️ **Warning:** This might be buggy and not work to keep Defender or other programs terminated.
